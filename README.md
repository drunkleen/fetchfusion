fetchfusion is a fork of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch). It's a command-line system information tool written in `bash 3.2+`. fetchfusion displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of fetchfusion is to be used in screen-shots of your system and dont let neofetch to be forgotten. fetchfusion shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's logo. You can further configure fetchfusion to instead use an image, a custom ASCII file, your wallpaper or nothing at all.

You can further configure fetchfusion to display exactly what you want it to. Through the use of command-line flags and the configuration file you can change existing information outputs or add your own custom ones.
